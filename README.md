This a project on Defending adversarial attack on computer vision models using image pre-processing

CNN - Code for creating the base model and saving it

Base_Image_Test - Code for testing the models acuuracy on unperturbed images

FGSM - Code for implementing adversarial attack and defendive mechanism. Switch between functions to use different prerpocessing methods.

Model_Training - Code for training the base model with preprocessed images and adversarial images.

Baseline.pth - Base model created using CNN

fgsm_trained.pth - Adversarial trained model

gauss_trained.pth - Gaussian blurred image trained model

median_trained.pth - Median filter image trained model

nlm_trained.pth - NLM Denoised image trained model
